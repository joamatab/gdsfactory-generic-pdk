## Devices Status

The following table explains the list of available Generic-PDK device we have supported in our LVS runset.

| Device Name                | Measured-Parameters                                        | Tested            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| mmi1x2                     | `length_mmi, width_mmi, gap_mmi, width_taper, length_taper`|:white_check_mark: |
| straight_heater_meander    | `heater_width`                                             |:white_check_mark: |
| dbr                        | `w1, w2, l1, l2, n`                                        |:white_check_mark: |

> **Note:** All supported devices include marker layers utilized for LVS purposes, which are added automatically through the [GenericPDK Pcells](../pymacros/README.md). If you've implemented these devices using an alternative method, you'll need to manually include these marker layers. Please refer to [GenericPDK-Layers](../README.md#layers) for more info about available layers.

## Usage

You have the option to execute the GenericPDK-LVS through either a Python script via the command-line interface (CLI) or by the Klayout graphical user interface (GUI), as detailed in the subsequent usage sections.

### CLI

The `run_lvs.py` script takes your gds and netlist files to run LVS rule decks with switches to select subsets of all checks.

```bash
    run_lvs.py (--help| -h)
    run_lvs.py (--layout=<layout_path>) (--netlist=<netlist_path>) [--thr=<thr>] [--run_dir=<run_dir_path>] [--topcell=<topcell_name>] [--run_mode=<run_mode>] [--verbose] [--lvs_sub=<sub_name>] [--no_net_names] [--spice_comments] [--scale] [--schematic_simplify] [--net_only] [--top_lvl_pins] [--combine] [--purge] [--purge_nets]
```

Example:
```bash
    python3 run_lvs.py --layout=testing/testcases/unit/lidar_device/lidar.gds --netlist=testing/testcases/unit/lidar_device/lidar.cdl --run_dir=lvs_lidar_run
```

#### Options

- `--help -h`                           Print this help message.

- `--layout=<layout_path>`              The input GDS file path.

- `--netlist=<netlist_path>`            The input netlist file path.

- `--thr=<thr>`                         The number of threads used in run.

- `--run_dir=<run_dir_path>`            Run directory to save all the results [default: pwd]

- `--topcell=<topcell_name>`            Topcell name to use.

- `--run_mode=<run_mode>`               Select klayout mode Allowed modes (flat , deep, tiling). [default: flat]

- `--lvs_sub=<sub_name>`                Substrate name used in your design.

- `--verbose`                           Detailed rule execution log for debugging.

- `--no_net_names`                      Discard net names in extracted netlist.

- `--spice_comments`                    Enable netlist comments in extracted netlist.

- `--scale`                             Enable scale of 1e6 in extracted netlist.

- `--schematic_simplify`                Enable schematic simplification in input netlist.

- `--net_only`                          Enable netlist object creation only in extracted netlist.

- `--top_lvl_pins`                      Enable top level pins only in extracted netlist.

- `--combine`                           Enable netlist combine only in extracted netlist.

- `--purge`                             Enable netlist purge all only in extracted netlist.

- `--purge_nets`                        Enable netlist purge nets only in extracted netlist.


#### LVS Outputs

You could find the run results at your run directory if you previously specified it through `--run_dir=<run_dir_path>`. Default path of run directory is `lvs_run_<date>_<time>` in current directory.

##### Folder Structure of run results

```text
üìÅ lvs_run_<date>_<time>
 ‚î£ üìú lvs_run_<date>_<time>.log
 ‚îó üìú <your_design_name>.cir
 ‚îó üìú <your_design_name>.lvsdb
 ```

The result is a database file (`<your_design_name>.lvsdb`) contains LVS extractions and comparison results.
You could view it on your file using: `klayout <input_gds_file> -mn <resut_db_file> `, or you could view it on your gds file via netlist browser option in tools menu using klayout GUI as shown below.

After selecting Netlist Browser option, you could load the database file and visualize the LVS results.

</p>

You can also locate the extracted netlist generated from your design at `<your_design_name>.cir` within the output directory of the run.

### GUI

The GenericPDK also facilitates LVS execution via Klayout menus, integrated with Klayout through the PDK [installation](../../README.md#installation) as depicted below:

Upon executing the LVS using the `Run Klayout LVS` option, the result database will appear on your layout interface, allowing you to verify the outcome of the run similarly as shown above in Fig. 2.
